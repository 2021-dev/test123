*SQLsmith*

* Description
SQLsmith is a tool that can generate random SQL queries.  Its paragon
is [[https://embed.cs.utah.edu/csmith/][Csmith]], which proved valuable for quality assurance in C compilers.

SQLsmith is still in an early protyping phase and hasn't exposed any
bugs in RDBMS products yet.  The only supported RDBMS is Postgres at
the moment.

* Dependencies:
- C++11
- libpqxx

* Usage
There are no options yet - you have to pass the connection credentials
via libpq environment variables.  It does send the generated queries
to the server and to stdout.  It also emits some progress indication
to stderr.  Example invocation:

: cd sqlsmith
: make sqlsmith
: PGPORT=5432 PGDATABASE=regress ./sqlsmith > /dev/null
