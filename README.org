*SQLsmith*

* Description
SQLsmith is a tool that can generate random SQL queries.  Its paragon
is Csmith, which proved valuable for quality assurance in C compilers.

SQLsmith is still in an early protyping phase and hasn't exposed any
bugs in RDBMS products yet.

* Dependencies:
- C++11
- libpqxx

* Usage
There are no options yet and you have to pass the connection
credentials via libpq environment variables.  It does send the
generated queries to the server and to stdout.  It also emits some
progress indication to stderr.
