* SQLsmith

** Description
SQLsmith is a tool that can generate random SQL queries.  Its paragon
is [[https://embed.cs.utah.edu/csmith/][Csmith]], which proved valuable for quality assurance in C compilers.

SQLsmith is still in an early protyping phase and hasn't exposed any
relevant bugs in RDBMS products yet.  The only supported RDBMS is
Postgres at the moment.

It might be useful in its current stage for safely putting arbitrary
databases under random load.

** Dependencies:
- C++11
- libpqxx

** Usage

sqlsmith connects to the target database to retrieve the schema for
query generation and to send the generated queries to.  Currently,
only read-only queries are generated.  Further, all generated
statements are rolled back.

Example invocation:

: cd sqlsmith
: make sqlsmith
: ./sqlsmith --verbose --target="host=/tmp port=65432"

The following options are currently supported:

| =--target=connstr= | target database (default: libpq defaults)        |
| =--log-to=connstr= | database for logging errors (default: don't log) |
| =--verbose=        | emit progress output                             |
| =--version=        | show version information                         |

Sample output:

=--verbose= makes sqlsmith emit some progress indication to stderr.  A
symbol is output for each query sent to the server.  Currently the
following ones are generated:

| symbol | meaning      | details                                       |
|--------+--------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| .      | ok           | Query generated and executed with ok sqlstate |
| s      | syntax error | These are bugs in sqlsmith - please report    |
| t      | timeout      | SQLsmith sets a statement timeout of 1s       |
| e      | other error  |                                               |

It also periodically emits error reports.  In the following example,
these are mostly caused by the primitive type system.

: queries: 39000 (202.399 gen/s, 298.942 exec/s)

The only one that looks interesting here is the cache lookup one.
Taking a closer look at it reveals that it happens when you query a
certain catalog view like this:

: self=# select indexdef from pg_catalog.pg_indexes where indexdef is not NULL;
: FEHLER:  cache lookup failed for index 2619

This is because the planner then puts =pg_get_indexdef(oid)= in a
context where it sees non-index-oids, which causes it to croak:

:                                      QUERY PLAN                                     
: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:  Hash Join  (cost=17.60..30.65 rows=9 width=4)
:    Hash Cond: (i.oid = x.indexrelid)
:    ->  Seq Scan on pg_class i  (cost=0.00..12.52 rows=114 width=8)
:          Filter: ((pg_get_indexdef(oid) IS NOT NULL) AND (relkind = 'i'::"char"))
:    ->  Hash  (cost=17.31..17.31 rows=23 width=4)
:          ->  Hash Join  (cost=12.52..17.31 rows=23 width=4)
:                Hash Cond: (x.indrelid = c.oid)
:                ->  Seq Scan on pg_index x  (cost=0.00..4.13 rows=113 width=8)
:                ->  Hash  (cost=11.76..11.76 rows=61 width=8)
:                      ->  Seq Scan on pg_class c  (cost=0.00..11.76 rows=61 width=8)
:                            Filter: (relkind = ANY ('{r,m}'::"char"[]))

Now this is more of a curiosity than a bug, but maybe someday SQLsmith
finds a real one...
