* Driver
** TODO [#C] multithreading
- generate next query while blocking on postgres
** TODO [#B] Log to a database					   :refactor:
- refactor the console logging
- make threaded in order to not block the main thing
** TODO Command line arguments
- conninfo for target
- conninfo for logging-db
- allow selecting/filtering schemas
* grammar
** TODO Allow productions to fail in factories
- Make productions throw a smith::no_candidate : std::runtime_error
- Catch it and randomly pick another one.
- Maybe count errors and escalate at some point
** DONE Add LATERAL
** TODO Add functions						     :schema:
** TODO Add aggregates						     :schema:
** TODO Add GROUP BY
** TODO Add window functions
** TODO Add FILTER
** TODO Add other DML
** TODO [#A] Allow constraining productions by return type

** TODO Generate data for literal use in queries
** TODO Improve random generation
- Add Attributes to rules so factories can pick candidates in a
  weighted fashion.
- This attribute could then also be used to blacklist productions for
  incompatible RDBMs
* schema
** TODO DTRT with arrays
* TODO support more RDMBSs
- Should add more than postgresl early to avoid a point of no return
- Allow blacklisting of productions for RDBMs with gaps wrt standards
  conformance (probably depends on improved random generation)
- Allow automatic detection of problematic productions via stats visitor
* relmodel
** TODO operations on Tuples
instead of hacking up tuples inside productions it's more sensible to
implement operators in relmodel.cc join() project() union() select()
** TODO Introduce basic semantic modeling
- use sampling of witness tuples instead of working on whole data base
** TODO primitive cost model
* Performance

sqlsmith is currently spending most of its time comparing and copying
=std::strings= around.  Also, the =C++11= RNG scores high in =perf=.
