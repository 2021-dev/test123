* Driver
** TODO [#C] multithreading
- generate next query while blocking on postgres
** TODO [#B] Log to a database					   :refactor:
- refactor the console logging
- make threaded in order to not block the main thing
** TODO Command line arguments
- conninfo for target
- conninfo for logging-db
- allow selecting/filtering schemas
* grammar
** DONE Add LATERAL
** TODO Add functions						     :schema:
** TODO Add aggregates						     :schema:
** TODO Add GROUP BY
** TODO Add window functions
** TODO Add FILTER
** TODO Add other DML
** TODO [#A] Allow constraining productions by return type

** TODO Generate data for literal use in queries
** TODO Improve random generation
- Add Attributes to rules so factories can pick candidates in a
  weighted fashion.
- This attribute could then also be used to blacklist productions for
  incompatible RDBMs
* schema
** TODO DTRT with arrays
* TODO support more RDMBSs
- Should add more than postgresl early to avoid a point of no return
- Allow blacklisting of productions for RDBMs with gaps wrt standards
  conformance (probably depends on improved random generation)
- Allow automatic detection of problematic productions via stats visitor
* relmodel
** tuples
instead of hacking up tuples the productions maybe it's more sensible
to implement operators in relmodel.cc
join() project() union() select()
** primitive semantic modeling
- use sampling of witness tuples instead of whole data base
** primitive cost model

* Performance

sqlsmith is currently spending most of its time comparing and copying
=std::strings= around.  Also, the =C++11= RNG scores high in =perf=.
